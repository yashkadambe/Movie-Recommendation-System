# Movie-Recommendation-System

1.Title of Project

  Movie Recommendation System

2.Objective

  To build a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history.

3.Data Source

  The dataset can be obtained from popular open-source sources, such as:
  MovieLens Dataset
  Kaggleâ€™s "The Movies Dataset" (link)
  These datasets typically contain user ratings, movie information, and sometimes tags or genres.

4.Import Library

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import difflib
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

5.Import Data

  # Load movie and 
  movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')

6.Describe Data

  print(movies.info())
  print(movies.head())

7.Data Visualization

Distribution of Ratings: Understand how ratings are distributed across users.
Most Popular Movies: Identify popular movies based on the number of ratings.
Genres Analysis: Check which genres are most commonly rated.

8.Data Preprocessing

 Remove Duplicates: If any.
Handle Missing Values: Fill or drop missing data in the movies and ratings datasets.
Data Transformation: Transform genres, if necessary, into separate columns.

9.Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X)

For a collaborative filtering model:

Target Variable (y): Ratings matrix (rating)
Feature Variables (X): User-movie interactions or user/item latent features for matrix factorization.
For content-based filtering:

Target Variable (y): Not applicable (item-based recommendation).
Feature Variables (X): Movie features like genre, cast, director, etc.

10.Train Test Split

Split the ratings data into training and testing sets.

python
Copy code
train, test = train_test_split(ratings, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

11.Modeling

Choose one or more recommendation algorithms:

Collaborative Filtering (Matrix Factorization) using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
Content-Based Filtering based on cosine similarity of movie features.
Hybrid Model combining collaborative and content-based filtering.

12.Model Evaluation

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for collaborative filtering.
Precision/Recall metrics for recommendation relevance.

13.Prediction

Generate recommendations for a particular user or movie.

python
Copy code
# Example prediction for a user
user_id = 1
recommended_movies = get_recommendations(user_id, model)
print("Recommended Movies:", recommended_movies)

Explanation

Provide a description of how the model makes recommendations and why certain movies are recommended based on user preferences or content similarity.
